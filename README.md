# UL-58  project is my second FULL stack project .
in this project I am building an application that allows the user to check online the compatibility of a construction drawing of a fuel tank to the requirments of UL-58 american standard, version 01/2018.

the application allows differnet types of users to check diffrent things:
1. inspector - can check main parameters of a tank (thickness, diameter, length, pressure endurance etc.).
2. engineer - a complete inspection of the tank's parameters (inspectors check and extra like welding properties, bracing etc.).

also for managing the DB a type Admin user.


the managing of users include creating users with activation mail etc.
